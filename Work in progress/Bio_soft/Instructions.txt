Project Title: DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

Project Description:
Create a DNA sequence analysis tool that allows users to input a DNA sequence and perform various analysis tasks on it. The tool should provide functionalities such as finding the reverse complement of the sequence, calculating the GC content, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), and detecting motifs or patterns within the sequence.

Features and Functionality:

Reverse Complement: Given a DNA sequence, the tool should generate its reverse complement. The reverse complement is formed by reversing the sequence and replacing each nucleotide with its complementary base (A with T, T with A, G with C, and C with G).

GC Content Calculation: Calculate the GC content of the DNA sequence, which is the percentage of nucleotides that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C) in the sequence.

Open Reading Frames (ORFs): Identify potential open reading frames in the DNA sequence. ORFs are sequences that start with a start codon (ATG) and end with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The tool should locate all possible ORFs and provide information such as the start position, stop position, and the translated amino acid sequence.

Motif Detection: Allow users to input a motif or a pattern (sequence of nucleotides) and search for occurrences of that motif within the DNA sequence. The tool should return the positions where the motif is found.

Additional Features: You can add additional features such as translation of the DNA sequence into protein sequence, identification of coding regions, prediction of secondary structures, or any other bioinformatics analysis that interests you.

Implementation:
You can implement the DNA sequence analysis tool using a programming language like Python. Utilize libraries such as Biopython or regular expressions (regex) to facilitate sequence manipulation and analysis. Create a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the tool and display the results.

Dataset:
You can either provide a sample DNA sequence as a default input or allow users to input their own DNA sequences through a file upload or direct input.

This project will provide a practical application of bioinformatics concepts and algorithms, allowing users to analyze and extract valuable information from DNA sequences. It can be extended with additional functionalities and visualizations to enhance its utility and educational value.
