# Bioinformatics
 This a repository for my bioinformatics tools. They are a collection of solutions I developed during coding practices 
 on websites such as Rosalind and assignment. 

DNA toolkit contains:
    []Core code: 
        -GC content calculator
        -DNA-->mRNA 
        -DNA-->protein
        -Complementary DNA sequence 
    []Base calculator: finds base percentage in a DNA strand

    []Mutation_quantifier: finds H-value given two DNA strands

    []Reading_frame: finds the reading frame in a DNA strand and return it in nucleotides 
    and translated to aminoacid sequence. 

    []sequence_identity calculates identity percentage between two sequences in two fasta files. **biopython library required.

[]Species_plotter a py to kml compiler can be found. 
This allows to plot species given coordinates and distance range. Distance is calculated using the coordinated provided. 
    -Mammal.txt (input file) and output.kml(output file) are sample data. 


Work in progress folder contains projects currently in development. They might not work due to bugs, flawed logic, etc... 
feel free to browse them and contribute.
