# Bioinformatics
 This a repository for my bioinformatics tools. They are a collection of solutions I came across during coding practices on websites such as Rosalind. 
DNA toolkit contains:
Core code: 
    -GC content calculator
    -DNA-->mRNA 
    -DNA-->protein
    -Complementary DNA sequence 
-Base calculator
-Mutation counter

In Species_plotter a py kml compiler can be found. 
This allows to plot species given coordinates and distance range. Distance is calculated using the coordinated provided. 
    -Mammal.txt and output.kml are sample data. 

Work in progress contains a series of projects currently in development. They might not work due to bugs, flawed logic, etc... 
feel free to browse them and contribute.
