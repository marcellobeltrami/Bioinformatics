## Bioinformatics tools :dna:

This a repository for my bioinformatics tools. They are a collection of solutions I developed during coding practices 
 on websites such as Rosalind and assignments. 

### **DNA toolkit** ðŸ”§
**Core code**: 
  -GC content calculator: calculates GC content of a string
  
   -DNA-->mRNA: converts a DNA string into mRNA. 
   
   -DNA-->protein: converts DNA into proteins. 
   
   -Complementary DNA sequence: converts DNA sequence in its complementary
    
**Base calculator**: finds base percentage in a DNA strand

**Mutation_quantifier**: finds H-value given two DNA strands

**Reading_frame**: finds the reading frame in a DNA strand and return it in nucleotides 
and translated to aminoacid sequence. 

**Sequence_identity**: calculates identity percentage between two sequences in two fasta files. **biopython library required.

### **Species plotting** ðŸ§­
**Species_plotter** a py to kml compiler. This allows to plot species given coordinates and distance range. Distance is calculated using the coordinated provided. 
    -Mammal.txt (input file) and output.kml(output file) are sample data. 

**Sequence distance** is a py script allowing to calculate the distance between an unknown sequence against a list of sequences. When applied to fictitious data, This script has been used to determine the closest sequence, aiding in determining the possible spreader between the two countries. 

### **Work in progress** :warning:

Work in progress folder contains projects currently in development. They might not work due to bugs, flawed logic, etc... 
feel free to browse them and contribute.
